## 🧪 Objective

To build a classification model that can predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant details and loan parameters.

## ⚙️ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, etc.)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Training of classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Final model prediction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip packages:
  ```
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Machine Learning Model Application on Loan Data Set.ipynb` and run all cells.

## 📂 Data Source
